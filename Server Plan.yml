Internal Server Plan:

    Socket:
        constructor:    createas a non blocking Socket
        bind:           binds the socket to an address and port specified by user
        listen:         starts listening on the socket
    
    INetAddress:        utility class for translating from string address

    Connection:
        read:           read from a connection
        write:          write to a connection

    Server:
        constructor:    creates a listener socket
        start:          starts listening
        onConnection:   a callback that gets called when a new connection comes in
        onReceive:      a callback that gets called when a message is received


    Poller:
      Poll:             waits for events to occur
      AddEvent:         registers a new handle that needs to be polled (AddEvent is a bad name; needs to change)
      RemoveEvent:      removes a handle that needs to be polled
